# PROGRESS / Session Handoff Notes

Last updated: 2026-09-12. Read this first in a new session; then continue with the
`# OPEN TASKS` section (especially the axe/pickaxe bug).

Companion docs: `PLAN.md`, `PLAN-class-skill-trees.md`, `planning.md`, `game-design.md`.

## 1o. Recent completed work (2026-09-12) — sword/shield defense animation + permanent-arm-corruption fix
User: "the sword and shield should have 2 set of animation for attack and defense… it only don't have
animation for that", then "if the player spam attack continuously the model might be bug and got
permanently altered". Root cause of the corruption: no single-owner phase machine — re-entering a
phase before it ended (spam/charge-cancel/guard) leaked `AcquireArms` claims, leaving `SuppressArms`
stuck so `PlayerAnimator` never restored the arms; plus attck/sway "rest" was captured from the live
(aesthetic-posed) bones, so `End()` re-committed a polluted pose as rest.
- `WeaponAnimator.cs`: new **defense guard** — the "defense" set alongside the attack swings. `PlayGuard()`
  / `EndGuard()` / `UpdateGuard()` ease the arms into a held guard pose (eased grab-in 0.18 s) while RMB
  blocking; per-weapon `GuardPoses` (t=1 hold keys): shields raise the face up in front, blades tuck a
  defensive guard, greatsword/warhammer/greataxe raise a two-hand cover, fists/gauntlets boxer guard,
  magic/ranged fall back to neutral (never block).
- **Single-owner phase fix**: `Acquire()`/`Release()` (idempotent, `_ownsArms`), `CaptureRest()` and a
  unified `End()` teardown. Every phase transition (attack/charge/guard/sway) abandons the old hold
  without releasing, so re-entrancy can't unbalance the arm-owner count; `OnDisable` does the same full
  teardown. Arm "rest" is now always **local identity** (the model's documented rest) instead of a live
  capture — a polluted capture can never bake an altered pose in. Weapon transform is still re-captured
  per phase (re-parent safe).
- `CombatController.cs`: `SetBlocking` drives `PlayGuard`/`EndGuard` on the state edge only, and
  `CanKeepBlocking()` (idle + loadout drawn) runs in `Update` so sheathing/stow drops the guard and the
  guard pose never fights the stow idle.
- `PlayerAnimator.cs`: watchdog — any rig driving the arms pings every frame (`PingArms`); if
  `SuppressArms` hangs > 0.5 s with no writer, owners are force-released + one log. Backstop if some
  unrelated flow ever leaks again.
### 1o-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending (guard pose
  angles are starting values — expect to tune):
  1. **No corruption**: spam LMB 30 s single + dual wield, interleave guard/attack/charge spam, walk
     + idle 5 s → arms always return to rest; no frozen/stuck arms; no `[PlayerAnimator] arm-owner
     claim hung` watchdog log during normal play.
  2. **Defense animation**: sword+shield → RMB hold raises the shield arm into a high guard, sword
     arm tucks (attack swings vs guard stance clearly distinct); release → settles back to the ready
     sway; blocked hits keep the guard until stamina breaks (then it drops).
  3. Fists/gauntlets boxer guard; greatsword two-hand cover; guard dropped cleanly on sheathe, and
     re-raised after re-draw while RMB still held.
- Worktree remains uncommitted (candidate commits: guard+anim fix, plus the earlier pending ones).

## 1p. Recent completed work (2026-09-12) — removed the game-start tool/food seed
User: "remove item that is not weapon from the player inventory … just delete the code that add them
into player inventory when the game start". The non-weapons came from the test-bench seeding, so the
tool-kit spawn was simply deleted — no new inventory plumbing.
- `NewWorldTestGround.cs`: removed `EnableTools`, `SpawnToolKit()` (axe/pickaxe/hoe/hammer/scythe/
  watering_can/fertilizer/club/rosary/fishing_rod ×1 + banh_mi/com_tam/nuoc_dau/mi_chinh/xap_phong ×5)
  and its two call sites in `SpawnBench()` and `GrantBenchBag()`. Weapons-only grants
  (`SpawnAllWeapons`, weapon rack) unchanged.
- Non-weapons can still enter the bag mid-game via pickups/crafting/shops — only the start-of-game
  seeding was removed, as requested.
### 1p-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: new game /
  bench spawn starts with only the weapon grants in the bag (no axe, no food); weapon rack + all
  catalog weapons still spawn; rest of the bench lanes (farming/enemies/buildings/NPCs) unaffected.

---

## 1q. Recent completed work (2026-09-12) — skill tree: aggressive zoom + node labels auto-size
User: "increase the zoom ability of the skill tree and fix the bug that the text is too big compare
to the node". Scope confirmed via question: **aggressive** zoom range (Min 0.08 / Max 10) and
**auto-size** labels that keep wrapping.
- Root cause of the text bug: node boxes and label fonts were sized on unrelated scales — general
  nodes are 18x14 / 12x10 / 8x6 px (`MakeTreeNode`) and class/race nodes are size*2 x size (24/18/14
  tall), while labels used `Screen.height/…` with `Max()` minimum clamps (8/8/6pt general, 10/8/7pt
  class/race) that dominate at 1080p+ — an 8pt font in a 10px box, 6pt in a 6px box, spilling over.
- `CharacterInfoUI.cs` `MakeTreeNode` / `MakeClassTreeNode` / `MakeRaceSkillTreeNode`: labels now use
  TMP auto-size bounded by the node itself — `enableAutoSizing`, `fontSizeMin 2f`, `fontSizeMax`
  derived from the node (`nh * 0.85` general, `size * 0.75` class/race), wrapping kept, with
  `overflowMode = Ellipsis` only as a last-resort for names that can't fit even at min size.
- `TreePan`: `MinScale 0.28 -> 0.08` (full-wheel overview), `MaxScale 3 -> 10` (close reading of tiny
  nodes), scroll step `1.2 -> 1.25` so the wider range is usable. `FitTreeToViewport` already clamps
  to these constants, so the automatic fit is unchanged.
- `FitTreeToViewport`: now also folds `_raceTreeNodes` into the max-radius fit (was omitted — Race
  sub-tab could under-fit).
### 1q-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: scroll-zoom
  all the way in (10x) and out (0.08x) on General/Class/Race sub-tabs; long skill names auto-shrink to
  fit their node and never spill outside it; the Race tree fits the viewport on open; no label blur/
  NRE during zoom/pan.

## 1r. Recent completed work (2026-09-12) — magic redesign: school signatures, real healing, persistent zones
User: "the magic is not very creative, most of the magic using the same thing over". Scope (confirmed):
leverage existing/dormant systems rather than add new delivery types — statuses/DoT, real healing,
knockback, and persistent zones. Applied to **both** the base 12 magic tree and the ~70-spell design
bank. Existing FP/cooldown/cast pipeline untouched.
- **School signatures** — Fire→Burn, Ice→Frost, Lightning→Stagger, Dark→Rot, Wind→Knockback (Tornado
  stays a pull), Holy→heals, Arcane→Stagger (bind/hold). Spells that previously differed only by power
  now read distinctly on hit.
- `SpellData.cs`: added `Duration`, `Heals`, `Knockback`; status fields kept with `StatusProcChance = 1f`.
- `SkillCatalog.cs` `Spell(...)` helper: new optional `heals`, `knockback`, `duration`, `statusEffect`
  params — shared by both catalogs. `BuildMagic` base 12 retuned; **Ward**/*Arcane Ward* and
  **Blizzard** converted from weak `Zone` to aimed `Spell` zones (Blizzard persistent 2.5 s + Frost).
- `SkillCatalog.Magic.cs`: L1 blocks (focus/arcane/fireball/frostbolt/dark/gust) and L2 headliners
  retuned — chain fork/arc/overload/leap→Stagger, Scorch Burn, Deep Freeze Stagger, chilled bolts
  Frost, Consume Rot, Mini Tornado→**Vortex** (8 m, pulls), airburst Crack/Pressure/Shockwave knockback,
  Arcane Shackles/Hold Stagger, and the whole heal family (Greater Heal, Light's Embrace, Purify,
  Mending Light, Radiance, Beacon, Sunburst, Regrowth, Restore, Bloom) now carry `heals: true`.
- New `IHealable.cs`; `PlayerController` implements it (uses its existing `Heal`).
- New `SpellDoT.cs` — Bleed/Poison/Rot/Burn ticker (per-tick = power × 0.12 over 4 s; refreshes).
- New `SpellZone.cs` — unified persistent zone (tick damage × per-delivery multiplier — Zone 0.4,
  Vortex 1.0 — optional pull, Holy heals `IHealable` allies inside per tick; lifetime expiry). Replaces
  and deletes `WindVortex.cs`.
- `SpellCaster.cs`: `ResolveZone` routes `Duration > 0` to persistent `SpellZone` and heals allies when
  `Heals`; `ApplyHit` gained heal branch + `ApplyStatus` (proc chance) + `ApplyKnockback`;
  `ResolveDirect` self-heals for Instant heal spells; `SpawnVortex` now spawns `SpellZone` (pull 3.5).
- Docs: `game-design.md` §3.7/§3.8 (signatures, healing, persistent `SpellZone`, fields).
### 1r-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: hit an
  enemy with each school and confirm the status/icons (Burn/Frost/Stagger/Rot) and Wind knockback;
  cast a Holy heal at low HP and confirm self-heal, and a Holy zone near allies; verify Tornado pulls
  and Blizzard ticks + chills; confirm projectiles still never detonate at the caster's feet.

---

## 1s. Recent completed work (2026-09-12) — magic projectile bolts no longer detonate on the caster/feet
User reported magic projectile spells "hit the ground way too often". Root cause: the bolt spawns
exactly at the in-hand rig root (no Muzzle offset — ranged uses a child Muzzle at local (0, 0.1, 1))
and SpellEffect's flight raycast hit EVERYTHING with no owner-root skip. The `~0` layer-mask ray cast
from the hand position clipped the player's own CharacterController capsule on the first frame and
detonated at the caster's feet, reading as a ground hit.
- `SpellEffect.cs` (`Update`): the flight raycast now ignores hits on the caster's own root
  (`hit.collider.transform.root != _caster.transform.root`) and keeps flying — mirrors
  `RangedProjectile.Update`. The splash `OverlapSphere` already skipped the caster's root.
- `SpellCaster.cs` (`FireProjectile`): spawn lifted clear of the body like the bow Muzzle —
  `pos += fwd * 0.5 + up * 0.3`. Applied only to projectiles; Instant/Zone/Vortex placement untouched.
### 1s-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: fire a
  projectile spell straight ahead / slightly downhill / at a close 3–5 m target / with an NPC beside
  the caster — bolt leaves the hand and only bursts on real obstacles; no puff at the feet; no
  self-damage from splash.

---

## 1t. Recent completed work (2026-09-12) — casting circle: two LineRenderer rings on own children
User reported a play-test crash: `NullReferenceException … CastingCircle.Build() (line 144)` on first
magic aim. Root cause (verified via Unity docs/QA): a GameObject can hold only **one** Renderer
component — `gameObject.AddComponent<LineRenderer>()` for the second (inner) ring returns null in
Unity 6, so `_innerRing.useWorldSpace` threw.
- `CastingCircle.cs`: each halo ring now owns its own child GameObject ("OuterRing" / "InnerRing",
  parented at local origin under the CastingCircle transform) before `AddComponent<LineRenderer>()`.
  Visuals identical — `useWorldSpace = false` means both rings still render in local space around the
  circle's origin, which the parent transform positions/rotates onto the weapon.
### 1t-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: hold LMB
  with armed magic → halo + inner spin ring appear (no NRE), charge grows, cast-burst ring still fires.

---
User: "some of the spell in the alt magic circle i'm sure is a physical skill, i want that circle to
consist of magic skills only." Scope confirmed (via question): also align `EnsureArmedMagic` auto-arm.
- `MagicWheelUI.cs`:
  - `RebuildEntries` filter is now `!skill.IsPassive && skill.Type == SkillType.Magic` — melee, ranged,
    stealth, crafting & fortitude castables never enter the wheel. (`Skill.IsMagical` was NOT used: it
    flags elemental flavor and would wrongly include `melee_berserk`/`ranged_arrowrain` and wrongly
    exclude `magic_heal`; `Type` is the correct gate and is carried onto every expanded magic-tree
    branch in `SkillCatalog.ExpandTree`.)
  - `EnsureArmedMagic` aligned: the "keep currently armed" path also requires the armed skill to be
    Magic-type, and both fallback passes arm only Magic-type skills — auto-arm can never pick a
    physical skill as the "magic".
  - Class doc-comment updated ("learned castable magic skill … magic category only").
- Docs: `game-design.md` §5.16 (wheel lists learned magic-category skills only); `PROGRESS.md` this
  section.
### 1u-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: armed
  melee/ranged/stealth skills no longer appear; all magic spells still present (incl. Holy Heal);
  player with only non-magic skills sees "No spells learned yet"; auto-arm without the wheel picks
  only magic skills.

---
User: change the magic Alt quick-choose from one big ring to "multiple circle". Scope confirmed (via
questions): concentric rings; keep hold-Alt / hover / release-to-select interaction and the same skill
set (learned non-passive, cap 64).
- `MagicWheelUI.cs`:
  - Layout driven by `InnerRingCap = 6` / `MidRingCap = 18` (outer ring takes the rest): slots
    `< 6` → inner, `< 24` → middle, else outer. 1–6 spells = single inner circle; 7–24 = inner+middle.
  - Per-ring radii (% of canvas height): inner 0.17, middle 0.30, outer 0.42; per-ring base slot sizes
    inner 0.11 / middle 0.085 / outer 0.07, then shrunk by `(2π·r)/(n·GapRatio)` so arcs keep a gap.
    Every ring is a full circle starting at −90° (concentric).
  - `CreateSlot(index, ringIndex, ringCount, skill)`; new `List<float> _slotSizes` (built/cleared with
    slots) so `Paint()` hover hits each slot with its own radius (`size · 0.78`, nearest wins).
  - Removed single-`_slotSize` / `_ringRadius` fields. Hover/cooldown-dim/armed-colour logic unchanged.
- Docs: `game-design.md` §5.16 ("3 concentric circles"); `PROGRESS.md` this section.
### 1v-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: 1–6 learned
  spells (single inner circle), 7–24 (inner+middle), 25–64 (three circles), hover/highlight/dim/armed
  colors, release-select, armed chip, fonts across all rings.

---
User: with 2 swords equipped both hands shared the same wait time; wanted each hand to swing
independently. Scope confirmed: per-hand timing for all dual melee; a dodge cancels an in-flight swing.
- `CombatController.cs`:
  - New `HandSwing` struct (`EndAt` / `LastEnd` / `Combo`) + `_swingR/_swingL`; predicate
    `PerHandScheme = HasLoadedDual && !BothHandsMagic` (same shape as `PlayerController.dualMode`).
  - Per-hand branch in `LightAttackWith(hand)`: gates on THAT hand's own timer (not the global `CanAct`)
    plus `CurrentState == Idle` (roll/heavy/parry still gate every hand). No global state change, so the
    other hand stays free. Same stamina cost / light-attack duration / `AttackSpeedScale` math; per-hand
    combo chain (pause > `ComboResetTime` reset, cap 3). Single / two-hand / both-magic keep the stock
    global path.
  - `TickHand(ref)` in `Update()` frees each hand and bumps its combo when the swing completes.
  - `Dodge()` cancels in-flight per-hand swings (`EndAt = 0`) so the roll reads cleanly.
  - `ResetCombo()` and `OnDisable()` also clear the per-hand state.
- Docs: `PROGRESS.md` this section. (`game-design.md` §5.16 already specified the independence.)
- Behavior notes: a shield guard can now stay raised while the other hand swings; a dodge still blocks
  new presses; body-animator attack triggers don't fire during per-hand swings (weapon rigs drive the
  visuals via `NotifyWeaponAnimator(hand, …)`).
### 1w-status
- Source-compile verified by the semantic checker (0 diagnostics). Unity play-test pending: 2 swords
  alternating/spam per hand (independent cadence), sword+shield guard-drop, dodge-mid-swing cancel,
  crossed ranged+melee, both-magic/single unchanged.

---

## 1z. Recent completed work (2026-09-11) — per-hand dual-wield mouse scheme
User: with 2 weapons equipped, make each mouse button drive its own hand (2 swords = LMB/RMB attack
separately); trade-off = no block except via a shield hand; sword+shield = sword side attacks & shield
side guards; magic in a mixed dual loses its charge (fires uncharged); both-magic/0-or-1 weapon keep
the standard scheme; ranged keeps its charge and the buttons cross (LMB→right hand's weapon, RMB→left
hand's) so a bow in the right hand fires on LMB ("the first mouse clicked fires the other one").
- `CombatController.cs`:
  - `HasLoadedDual` (both hands = real non-fist rigs; fists never count), `BothHandsMagic` (both-magic
    keeps the normal aim/charge/fire flow), `HasRangedDual` (crossed-button trigger).
  - Public `CategoryOfHand(hand)` (wraps private `CategoryOf`).
  - `LightAttack()`/`FireRanged(charge)` now resolve through new `HandOf(behavior)`; added per-hand
    `LightAttackWith(hand)` and `FireRangedWith(hand, charge)` (resolve that hand's behavior — the
    dual scheme) that can't be used while blocking.
  - New `NotifyWeaponAnimator(hand, …)` animates only the acting hand in per-hand attacks; the
    existing broadcast `NotifyWeaponAnimators` stays for the heavy/mobile paths.
- `PlayerController.cs`:
  - New `_dualChargeL/_dualChargeR` accumulator per hand; `HandleDualModeCombat` +
    `HandleDualHand` dispatch each mouse button to one hand: Melee = swing on press, Shield = guard
    while held (release unguards), Magic (mixed) = `MagicWheelUI.EnsureArmedMagic` +
    `ReleaseArmedCast(0)` on press (uncharged), Ranged = hold-to-charge (`MagicChargeLevel`) +
    release-to-fire (`FireRangedWith`).
  - `dualMode = FightingMode && !IsMobile && HasLoadedDual && !BothHandsMagic`; guards skip the old
    `_aiming` block, LMB-press block and RMB-block branch while in dual mode. Attack press auto-releases
    a raised guard before swinging. Gates: Not FightingMode (stowed weapons) or mobile ⇒ stock behavior.
- Docs: `game-design.md` §5.4 (Dual hand-state bullet) + §5.16 controls (full dual scheme table);
  `PROGRESS.md` this section.
### 1z-status
- Source-compile verified by review (Unity project — no CLI build, not play-tested).

---

## 1y. Recent completed work (2026-09-11) — shield weapons (Block category)
User: "the game have shield skill but nt a sheild, add it in." User confirmed scope: new
`WeaponCategory.Shield`, 3 shields, shields = strictly better block.
- `WeaponCategory.cs`: new `Shield = 3` (`Melee/Ranged/Magic/Shield`).
- `WeaponData.cs`: new guard mods `BlockAbsorbPercent = 0.8f` (min — default 80% absorb, matching
  the old bare-hand guard) + `BlockStaminaDrainMult = 1f` under `[Header("Per-Category (Shield)")]`.
- New `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Weapons/ShieldWeaponBehavior.cs` (+ `.meta`, guid
  `d118249d90894ed682054489e68be0a2`): `[RequireComponent(HitboxSystem)]`, `IWeaponBehavior` bash —
  mirrors `MeleeWeaponBehavior` (Str-scaled hit, `Completed` fires when the $ hitbox is not active).
  - Repo `.meta` convention (verified this session): metas are the **minimal 2-line format**
    (`fileFormatVersion: 2` + `guid: …`) like `CastingCircle.cs.meta` / `MeleeWeaponBehavior.cs.meta`.
    The first shield commit wrote a full 11-line `MonoImporter` block instead, which Unity rejected
    ("YAML Parsing error — Parser Failure at line 11"), so the asset was ignored and the downstream
    compile died at `WeaponDatabase.cs:28` with `CS0246` for `ShieldWeaponBehavior`. Rewrote it to the
    2-line form (guid kept `d118249d90894ed682054489e68be0a2`) — imports and compiles in Unity.
- `WeaponCatalog.cs`: 3 shields via new `MakeShield` helper —
  `buckler` (wt 2, req 1, base 4, Dex scale, absorb 0.85, drain ×0.6, skill `wskill_buckler`),
  `round_shield` (wt 5, req 3, base 6, Str, absorb 0.9, ×0.7, `wskill_round_shield`),
  `tower_shield` (wt 9, req 6, base 8, Str, absorb 0.95, ×0.8, `wskill_tower_shield`).
- `WeaponModelBuilder.cs`: `BuildBuckler` / `BuildRoundShield` / `BuildTowerShield` proc-cube models +
  dispatcher cases.
- `WeaponRigBuilder.cs`: `Shield` BuildRig case (ShieldWeaponBehavior + databind); `DrawPoseFor`
  shield branch (flat on forearm, `(side*0.08, -0.35, 0.18)`, identity rot — face normal = +Z);
  `StowPoseFor` shield branch (flat on back, `(0, 0.32, -0.26)`, Euler(0,180,0)).
- `WeaponAnimator.cs`: shared `ShieldBashKeys` track (forward jab / lateral sweep / overhead slam);
  per-id defs `buckler`/`round_shield`/`tower_shield` (sd 0.28/0.32/0.38, so 0.40/0.46/0.55).
- Blocking is now shield-aware (`CombatController.cs` + `PlayerController.cs`):
  - `CombatController`: new `EquippedShield` (scans both hands for `Category==Shield`), `HasShield`,
    `BlockTakenMultiplier` (= 1 − shield `BlockAbsorbPercent`, else 0.2) and `BlockDrainMultiplier`
    (= shield `BlockStaminaDrainMult`, clamped ≥0.1). `OnBlockedHit` divides drain by class
    `BlockingMul` again and multiplies by `BlockDrainMultiplier`.
  - `PlayerController.TakeDamage`: blocked hits now use `combat.BlockTakenMultiplier` (was hard-coded
    ×0.2 — updated `if (amount <= 0) return;` guard kept).
  - `PlayerController` RMB gate: `IsMeleeEquipped(combat) || IsShieldEquipped(combat)` (new helper →
    `combat.HasShield`) so a shield-only or sword+shield guard blocks; bow/staff + shield still
    reserves RMB for aim/charge.
- No `NewWorldTestGround.cs` change needed: `SpawnAllWeapons` already loops the whole
  `WeaponCatalog.All` list (EnsureOwned + AddItem), so the 3 shields are granted & rack-displayed
  automatically.
- Docs: `game-design.md` §3.6 (4-category wording, Shield row + Layer 1/2/3 + Notes bullet on the
  off-hand defense / RMB pairing), §5.16 controls line ("block (melee or shield)");
  `PROGRESS.md` this section.

### 1y-status
- Unity integration complete: the `.meta` rewrite (2-line format) fixed both the YAML parse error and
  the CS0246, and the shield script now imports and compiles. Blocking math verified by code review
  only — not play-tested (no human-in-loop fight test yet).

---

## 1x. Recent completed work (2026-09-11) — skill-tree link highlight, magic wheel, casting circle

### 1x-a. Skill-tree links black; clicked node lights its links white
User: "change nodes link to black, add functions that light up the link when clicking a skill."
- `CharacterInfoUI.cs`: `LineInert` and `LineActive` both now `Color.black`; new `LineHighlight =
  Color.white` (~line 141-143). `RefreshSkillTree` picked every `_treeLine` line once more after
  painting: a line goes white if `target.id == selected` OR the selected skill appears in
  `target.PrereqSkillIds` (i.e. the clicked node's direct parent→child links).
- Decision (user-confirmed): the highlight algorithm lives in `CharacterInfoUI.cs`, NOT
  `SkillCatalog.Ranged.cs` / the catalog partials — those stay data-only.

### 1x-b. Magic wheel (Alt) — labels now visible + capacity 16 → 64
Complaint: wheel circles had no text (only the centre hint named the spell) and 16 slots was too
small once the spell pool grew.
- `MagicWheelUI.cs`:
  - `MaxEntries` 16 → 64.
  - New `_slotSize` / `_ringRadius` fields; `RebuildEntries` now sizes dynamically —
    `_slotSize = min(h*0.13f, (maxRadius*2π)/(count*1.15f))`, `_ringRadius = min(max(h*0.28f,
    count*_slotSize*1.15f/2π), maxRadius = h*0.42f)` (h = canvas height in px). Ring grows with skill
    count, slots shrink with 1.15× arc gap so all 64 fit on screen.
  - Fixed latent bug: `CreateSlot` built the label but never assigned `.text`
    (`slot.label.text = skill.displayName`), font `max(7f, slotSize*0.42f)`,
    `enableWordWrapping = false`, `overflowMode = Ellipsis` — long names truncate, full name in the
    centre hint on hover.
  - `Paint` hover hit-radius now `_slotSize * 0.78f` (was hardcoded) so picking stays accurate on the
    small slots.

### 1x-c. Casting circle — halo around the magic weapon while charging (new files)
Feature: visible ring around the weapon during aim/charge so a charging cast reads clearly.
- New `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Effects/CastingCircle.cs` (+ `.meta`, guid
  `0c99a538ff784eab94de853363fa8fc8` since the repo tracks meta files). Lazy singleton
  (`Instance`), prefab-free (builds objects in code like `AoeAimPreview`):
  - Disc (solid translucent) + outer LineRenderer ring (48 seg, 0.06 width) + inner spinning ring
    (36 seg, 0.03 width, faster spin). Orientation: ring plane ⊥ weapon up-axis
    (`Quaternion.LookRotation(up)`).
  - `Show(anchor, charge, color)`: radius 0.35 → 0.75, alpha 0.35 → 1, spin `18f + charge*60f` deg/s —
    all lerped by charge.
  - `Burst(radius, color, upDir)` → one-shot `SkillFx.RingFlash` on cast release.
  - `Hide()` sets all renderers inactive (keeps one-shot rings playing).
- `PlayerController.cs`: new `_castingCircle` field. `UpdateCastingCircle(charge)` called right after
  `UpdateAoePreview` in the magic aim path; on cancel `HideCastingCircle()`; on release
  `BurstCastingCircle(charge)` then `HideCastingCircle()`, then `MagicWheelUI.ReleaseArmedCast(charge)`.
  Helpers `Casting()`, `MagicHand(CombatController)`, `HandIsMagic(GameObject)` (~lines 1140-1210).

### 1x-status
- All three compile-level verified (git diff reviewed; no name conflicts). **Not yet visually
  confirmed in Unity** — next session: play with a magic weapon, Alt-wheel >64 spells, charge and
  eyeball the halo + white link highlight.

## 1. Recent completed work (race/class skill trees + general tree layout)

### 1a. Race skill tree system (files created this round)
- `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Skills/RaceSkill.cs` — `RaceSkill` + `RaceMod{kind,amount}` + `RaceModType`
  (31 enum values, including `AttackSpeedMul`, `DefenseMeleeMul`, `HpRegenPerSecond`...).
- `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Skills/RaceSkillCatalog.cs` — 22 race builders (`BuildHuman` … `BuildElf`),
  helper `Make(list, raceId, node, name, layer, passive, cost, prereqs, desc, IRaceEffect effect = null, params RaceMod[] mods)`.
- `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Skills/RaceEffect.cs`, `RaceSkillCaster.cs`.
- `Assets/Scripts/Player/Races/RaceSkillPassiveManager.cs`, `RaceSkillState.cs`.

Guidelines that MUST be preserved:
- Skill id convention: `rac.{raceId}.{node}`; cooldown key: `"race_" + id`.
- `RaceModType` semantics: `*Bonus` = flat add to race stat % modifier; `*Mul` = multiplier (1+Σ);
  `HpRegenPerSecond` / `EquipLoadBonus` = flat adds.
- `DamageType` has NO `Poison` — Serpent-kin venom uses `DamageType.Dark` (RaceSkillCatalog.cs:253).
- Multi-mod `Make(...)` calls: pass `null` for `effect` positionally, or use the named-array form
  `mods: new[] { M(...), M(...) }`. A named `mods:` followed by an unnamed arg is a compile error
  (this already burned us twice: CS8323 then CS1503).
- Current multi-mod nodes: Orc "Thick Hide" (line ~636), Dwarf "Thick Skin" (~975), Elf "Swift Blade" (~1048).
- Catalog is uniform for all races: 1 hub (L0) + 3 paths (L1) + 6 leaves (L2) = 10 nodes.

Integration (all verified to compile before this handoff):
- `PlayerStats.cs` — `AddTemporaryStatBuff`, `GetTotal` now adds race-skill stat bonus + temp buffs,
  many derived stats multiply by `ActiveRaceSkillMods?.XxxMul ?? 1f`. `DevMaxAllStats` stays `true`.
- `SkillProfile.cs` — `Execute` falls back to `RaceSkillCatalog`/`RaceSkillCaster` for `rac.*` ids.
- `RaceChangeManager.cs` — `ApplyRace` now always refreshes/ensures the race-skill components
  (`RaceSkillPassiveManager.Refresh()` + `RaceSkillState.SetRace(...)`).
- `CharacterInfoUI.cs` — new Race tab/tree/detail/hotkey-assign wiring.

### 1b. General skill tree layout recalc (JUST DONE — not yet visually confirmed)
Complaint: "Layer 1 has too many slots; skills that branch from layer 1 are taking those slots."
- Root cause is DATA, not layout: `SkillCatalog.ExpandTree` (SkillCatalog.cs:381) makes 5 L1 + 25 L2
  children per base skill ⇒ 2,046 nodes (66 L0 + 330 L1 + 1650 L2). L1 ring capped at ~60 slots per
  wedge so it overflowed; the 130px L1→L2 moat wasn't enough, so deep skills read as "still on Layer 1".
- User directive (final): "recalculate the space" — reduce the L1 area so L2 skills clearly land on
  Layer 2, WITHOUT reducing the catalog.
- Applied in `CharacterInfoUI.RebuildSkillTree` (constants block ~line 1010):
  - `ring0` 280 → 250; `moatBase` 300 → 250 (L1 ring1 r=500); `branchStep` 16 → 22 (L1 ring2 r=522);
    `moatBranch` 130 → **280** (L2 first ring r=802); `deepStep` 120 → 180; `hubR` 180 → 170.
  - `layerPitch` {20,10,12} → {22,10,14}.
  - Ring-allocation math untouched; L2 is still pinned to ring 3+ (never shares an L1 ring).
- Also verified: ring1 cap now floor(500*1.04/10)=52, ring2 54 → L1 band holds max 70 (Magic) fine.
- NOT yet visually confirmed in Unity — next session should eyeball the tree.

### 1b-update (2026-09-11): ROOT fix — Layer 1 is now true-roots × 5, not 10 bases × 5
The real bug was DATA: `SkillCatalog.ExpandTree` expanded ALL 10 raw L0 skills per category
(5 true roots + 5 hand-authored locked skills) → 55 eff-L1 nodes (Magic 78), not the intended 25.
Fixed in `SkillCatalog.ExpandTree` (SkillCatalog.cs:381): a 4-line pre-pass promotes every
Layer-0 skill that has a prereq to Layer 2 (the deep band), so expansion now only branches the true
roots → L1 = 25 per category (Magic/Fortitude 30, they have 6 roots), L2 = 125 (+ relabeled locks).
`CharacterInfoUI` tier-band comment updated (lines 1001-1008) to match. No layout constants changed.

### 1c-update (2026-09-11): TRUE-depth layering — L2 no longer overfiles, L3 owns the deepest chains
Follow-up complaint: "same problem on layer 2-3" — the flat "promote every lock to Layer 2" fix from
1b crowded L2 (Melee 130 / Ranged 130 / Magic 158 / Stealth 130 / Crafting 130 / Fortitude 154 against
ring caps 59/72/86) and 2-3-hop chains (Tornado, Masterwork, Heart-Seeker) read as a phantom layer 3.
Fix (`SkillCatalog.ExpandTree`, still SkillCatalog.cs:381): each hand-authored lock now gets its TRUE
prereq-chain depth (root=0, branch=1, deep=2/3) via a DAG depth walk. Depth-1 locks take the 5 slots of
the root they hang from (authored first, synthetic fill) so L1 stays exactly 25/30; a lock that spans
multiple roots (Assassinate: Backstab + Sly Fox) is deduped so it never spawns duplicate L2 children.
Depth-2 locks sit with the synthetic L2 grandkids; depth-3 locks form a real Layer 3 band (0-1 nodes).
New counts: Melee 5/25/126/-, Ranged 5/25/126/1, Magic 6/30/152/1, Stealth 5/25/126/-, Crafting
5/25/126/1, Fortitude 6/30/151/-. `CharacterInfoUI.EffLayerOf` simplified to return `s.Layer` (data is
now final); tier-band + depth comments updated. No layout constants changed.

### 1d-update (2026-09-11): L1 uses its freed room — bigger nodes, wider gaps, closer to the roots
With L1 now a single row of 25/30, its ring band is repurposed for readability: L1 nodes grow
8x7 → 12x10 and `layerPitch` L1 10 → 16 (edge gap 2px → ~4px; ring1 cap 52 → 30, Magic/Fortitude
fill it exactly), label font bumps 7→8. `moatBase` 250 → 220 pulls ring1 in to r=470 so Layer 0 and
Layer 1 sit closer. Derived ring caps rechecked: r1=470(30), r3=772(57), r4=952(70), r5=1132(84) —
all L2 bands (126-152) and lone L3 nodes still fit.

### 1e-update (2026-09-11): L2 gets real room — bigger wheel, two spacious rings, no catalog cut
Complaint: "layer 2 doesn't have enough space, more than half the skills got pushed up to layer 3".
Root cause: ring3 (r=772) held only 57 L2 nodes vs 126-152, so 55-62% poured onto rings 4-5 (read as
"layer 3"). No catalog shrink (Option C chosen): `moatBranch` 280 → 550 and `deepStep` 180 → 260.
ring3 r=1042 (cap 77), ring4 r=1302 (cap 96) → every category's L2 fits 2 well-sized rings
(Magic 152 = 77+75, ring4 ~78% full), and true L3 (Tornado/Masterwork/Heart-Seeker) sits alone on
ring5 r=1562. L1 band untouched. New derived caps: r3=1042(77), r4=1302(96), r5=1562(116), r6=1822(135).

### 1f-update (2026-09-11): SHELVED — "2 synthetic grandchildren per L1" (skill cut)
Cut synthetic L2 grandkids 5 → 2 per L1 and pitched L2 to 16 so the band fit one ring. User REJECTED
the skill reduction: "i dont want to reduce the amount of skills, i want to keep the amount as it is".
Full catalog restored (5/L1). SUPERSEDED by 1g. Kept only `layerPitch` L2 = 16 from this attempt.

### 1g-update (2026-09-11): L2 keeps ALL skills — balanced 3-ring band, no ring packed to the seams
Complaint: cut is not acceptable; L2 must keep 5 grandchildren/L1 (126-152 nodes/category, ~1034 total).
Physics: that volume can't sit on one ring, so instead of greedily filling the innermost ring until it
is 100% full, `CharacterInfoUI` allocator (CharacterInfoUI.cs:1142) now SPREADS dense bands: each L2
node picks the least-loaded ring of a 3-ring band (rings 4-6 = r=1092/1372/1652), growing the band only
if capacity demands. Every ring ends up ~50-73% full with 6px gaps instead of one seam-packed ring.
Radii: `moatBranch` 550 → 600 (ring3 r=1092), `deepStep` 260 → 280 (r4=1372, r5=1652). L2 caps at
16px pitch: 70/89/107 (Magic 152 = ~51 per ring). True L3 (Tornado/Masterwork/Heart-Seeker) sits singly
on ring6 r=1932 (cap 167). SkillCatalog.ExpandTree back to `ci < 5`; class doc ~1034 restored.
L0 (6 roots) and L1 (exactly 25/30 on ring1) untouched.

### 1h-update (2026-09-11): L2 collapsed to a SINGLE ring — verified against real content files
Re-check after the six SkillCatalog.{Category}.cs content files landed (960 new skills, ExpandTree now
produces layer counts 126/126/152/126/126/151): every L2 child is `Layer=2` and max authored depth is 3
(only Tornado/Masterwork/Heart-Seeker), so no L4 and no overflow exists in DATA. What read as "pushed to
layer 3/4" was the 1g 3-ring L2 spread (rings 3-5) — L2 nodes visually occupied two extra rings.
User chose single-ring L2. Changes in CharacterInfoUI.cs:
- `layerPitch` L2 16 → 10; L2/L3 nodes 10x7 → 8x6 (2px gaps), so one ring seats all 126-152 nodes.
- `moatBranch` 600 → 998: ring3 r=1092 → 1490 (cap 154 @ 10px ≥ Magic 152). ring4 r=1770 (cap 153) = L3.
- Allocator band hard-coded 3-ring for L2 → `band = 1` (single ring; still grows outward only if a layer
  ever exceeds a ring's capacity).
Simulation (real counts): L2 = exactly ring3 for all 6 categories (126/126/152/126/126/151 ≤ 154),
L3 = exactly ring4 (Ranged/Magic/Crafting 1 each); wheel maxR shrinks 1972 → ~1810.

## 2. OPEN TASK — axe chopping / pickaxe mining is silently broken (PRIORITY)

### Symptom (confirmed by user answers)
- Game runs, hotbar visible (Casual mode), axe tool selected.
- Left-click on a tree/rock: **no chop mark, tree never progresses/falls**, and **no Console errors**.
- Player earlier reported "chop/mining animation runs" but the follow-up answers supersede that:
  no ChopMark, no progress, no errors.

### What has been ruled out (verified by reading code)
- `git status` shows only 4 modified files: `SkillProfile.cs`, `RaceChangeManager.cs`,
  `PlayerStats.cs`, `CharacterInfoUI.cs` (+ new race/class skill files). Nothing else.
- The full gather pipeline is UNCHANGED and has NO dependency on skills/races/classes/stats:
  - Input: `PlayerController.cs:873` LMB (not FightingMode) → `ToolManager.UseSelectedItem()`.
  - Tool paths: `ToolManager.cs:772-856` (axe) / 838-856 (pickaxe).
  - Stamina gate: `TryUseTool`/`SpendToolStamina` (ToolManager.cs:122-146) — only checks `player.Stamina`.
  - World: `WorldBuilder.TreeChop.cs` (`ChopTree`/`CutTree`, ChopMark creation at line 94) and
    `WorldBuilder.RockMining.cs` (`HitRock`, cracks at `UpdateRockCracks`), 4-hit completions.
- Registration: trees/rocks ARE added to `WorldBuilder._trees/_rocks` during `CreateWorld`
  (`WorldBuilder.WorldEnv.cs:407/437`, called from `WorldBuilder.cs:476-477`).
  `FindTreeRoot` (ToolManager.Pickup.cs:203) matches any parent named `Tree*`.
- Swing animation (`PlaySwing`, ToolManager.cs:274) only fires via `SpendToolStamina` AFTER a
  successful chop/mine — so if nothing ever progresses, the swing shouldn't be playing either.

### Why silent no-chop (ranked hypotheses for next session)
1. **Hit collider → `FindTreeRoot`/`IsRock` mismatch or unregistered root.** If the tree/rock the
   player clicks was NOT created by `WorldBuilder.CreateWorld` (e.g., a static/MapBuilder-built
   decor tree in the active test scene, or a saved-game rebuild), `_trees.Contains(treeRoot)` is
   false ⇒ `ChopTree`/`HitRock` returns false on every click: no mark, no progress, no error. Very likely.
2. **Raycast never hits the tree collider** (layer mask / collider removed by `MeshCombiner` or
   colliderless prefab leaves). Script then never enters the axe/pickaxe branch.
3. `_worldBuilder` null in `ToolManager` (would throw though — user reports no errors, so unlikely).
4. A runtime exception elsewhere silently swallows the click via the pre-gate at line 723
   (`TryUseTool` false ⇒ "Quá mệt!" toast — user would see the toast; they said no errors).

### Fix applied 2026-09-11 (lazy registration + chunk parent traversal) — needs Unity test
Root cause CONFIRMED: the new infinite-world path (`ChunkObject.SpawnProps`, `EnableLegacyGeneration
= false` default) spawns trees/rocks under `TerrainChunk_X_Z` and does NOT add them to
`WorldBuilder._trees`/`_rocks`. The raycast works fine (trunk/branch/rock cubes keep BoxColliders);
the game logic silently rejected the hit:
- Axe: `FindTreeRoot` finds `Tree_X_Z` (prefix match OK) but `ChopTree` -> `_trees.Contains` = false.
- Pickaxe: the rock walk-up stopped only on `"WorldRoot"`, so it walked PAST `Rock_X_Z` up to the
  `ChunkObject`, then `HitRock` -> `_rocks.Contains` = false.

Changes (code, not yet verified in Editor):
- `WorldBuilder.TreeChop.cs` — `ChopTree` (line ~30) and `RemoveTree` (line ~8): lazy-register the
  tree into `_trees` if missing instead of returning false.
- `WorldBuilder.RockMining.cs` — `HitRock` (line ~8) and `RemoveRock` (line ~421): same lazy
  registration into `_rocks`.
- `ToolManager.cs` — rock parent walk-up (pickaxe branch, line ~840) and debris walk-up (axe
  fallback, line ~825) now also stop when the parent is a `ChunkObject` (in addition to `"WorldRoot"`).

### Next session: verify in Unity
1. Open the scene the user tests in (infinite world / chunk path). Play, select axe, chop a tree:
   expect a black ChopMark after the first swing, trunk shrinks and a TreeFelled drops on the 4th hit.
2. Select pickaxe, mine a rock: expect cracks after each hit, rock shatters into RockDebris on the
   4th hit (debris is pick-up-able / smashable).
3. Also verify legacy path still works if `EnableLegacyGeneration` is ever toggled on.
4. If trees/rocks STILL silently do nothing, instrument with `Debug.Log` probes in
   `ToolManager.UseSelectedItem` (as previously planned) — now the most likely remaining cause would
   be the raycast itself missing (line 770), not registration.
5. Known minor leak (pre-existing): chunk-unloaded trees/rocks stay as stale null entries in
   `_trees`/`_rocks`; harmless to chopping (null-guarded) but inflates respawn counters.

## 5. Skill tree content design — continuation plan (2026-09-11)

### What's been done
- **SkillCatalog.cs refactored** to `public static partial class SkillCatalog` with:
  - `BranchSlot` class (IsAuthored, Id, Name, IsPassive, Cost, IsMagical, Kind, Effect, Desc).
  - `A(authoredId)` — shortcut for referencing an existing skill from Build*.
  - `S(id, name, effect, desc, cost, kind, magical, passive)` — shortcut for a new hand-written skill.
  - `DesignBank` (Dictionary L1[rootId] → 5 BranchSlot[], Dictionary L2[parentId] → 5 BranchSlot[]).
  - `_design` field + `Design` lazy property + `BuildDesignBank()` calling `Register*Design(bank)`.
  - **ExpandTree rewritten** to read from `Design.L1` / `Design.L2` tables instead of generating
    suffix names. Authored slots (A(...)) resolve existing skills by id; new slots (S(...)) get
    Add(...). Multi-root dedupe via `layer1Ids` preserved.
  - Old synthetic machinery removed: `_suffixesByType`, `_activeElements`, `_passiveStats`,
    `ScaledCost`, `ActiveCostForLayer`, `MakeChildEffect` all deleted.
- **Content files created 2026-09-11** — all 6 partial files now exist:
  `SkillCatalog.Melee.cs`, `SkillCatalog.Ranged.cs`, `SkillCatalog.Magic.cs`,
  `SkillCatalog.Stealth.cs`, `SkillCatalog.Crafting.cs`, `SkillCatalog.Fortitude.cs`.
  `Register*Design(bank)` methods are resolved; `BuildDesignBank()` compiles.
  VERIFIED (static sweep, no Unity compile): per-category L1/L2 tables are exact
  bijections (every L1 child has an L2 table, every L2 key is an L1 child),
  22 authored `A()` refs + 6× L0 root keys all resolve to existing `Build*` ids,
  zero duplicate skill ids, 98 unique `Spell()` ids with no collision vs the 9 base spells.

### Architecture for content files
Each category gets its own file: `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Skills/SkillCatalog.{Category}.cs`.
Each file contains:
```csharp
partial class SkillCatalog
{
    private static void Register{Category}Design(DesignBank bank) { /* populate bank.L1 + bank.L2 */ }
}
```
Content uses `A()` and `S()` helpers (private static in the main partial), plus existing effect
helpers: `Buff(stat, amt)`, `Slash(power, kind)`, `Zone(radius, power, kind)`, `Spell(...)`,
`Stamina(amt)`, `Focus(amt)`, `P(ids)`.

### Node counts per category (new = hand-written)

### Remaining categories — design approach (not yet drafted)

**Ranged** (5 roots: marksman, carry, pierce, quickshot, flamearrow)
- Auth L1: steady(marksman), multishot(pierce), iceshot(flamearrow). Auth d2: arrowrain[multishot]. Auth d3: heartseeker[arrowrain].
- 25 L1 + 125 L2 to design. Theme families: accuracy (marksman), speed (carry), piercing (pierce), rapid-fire (quickshot), elemental arrows (flamearrow).

**Magic** (6 roots: focus, arcane, fireball, frostbolt, dark, gust)
- Auth L1: manaflow(arcane), chain(fireball), heal(focus), ward(arcane), windblade(gust). Auth d2: blizzard[chain+frostbolt], gale[windblade]. Auth d3: tornado[gale].
- 30 L1 + 150 L2 to design. Theme families: FP/intelligence (focus), ward/utility (arcane), fire line, ice line, dark line, wind line.

**Stealth** (5 roots: shadow, reflexes, fox, nimble, backstab)
- Auth L1: sneak(reflexes), veil(shadow), cloak(nimble), assassinate(backstab+fox). Auth d2: shadowstep[veil].
- 25 L1 + 125 L2 to design. Theme families: darkness (shadow), agility (reflexes), trickery (fox), speed (nimble), stealth attacks (backstab).

**Crafting** (5 roots: hands, knowledge, focus, endurance, efficiency)
- Auth L1: purity(hands), refine(knowledge), repair(knowledge). Auth d2: transmute[purity]. Auth d3: forge[transmute] (Masterwork).
- 25 L1 + 125 L2 to design. Theme families: quality/luck (hands), recipes (knowledge), concentration (focus), stamina (endurance), speed (efficiency).

**Fortitude** (6 roots: health, armor, recovery, bulwark, stoneskin, guro)
- Auth L1: vitality(health), stamina(armor), steadfast(armor). Auth d2: wall[steadfast+stoneskin].
- 30 L1 + 150 L2 to design. Theme families: HP (health/recovery/bulwark), defense (armor), earth (stoneskin), grit (guro).

### Conventions to follow
- **Ids**: `{category}_{root}_{name}` for L1, `{l1_id}_{name}` for L2. Semantic, not numeric.
- **Names**: short, punchy (1-3 words). Match existing tone (Whirlwind, Berserk Slash, Execute).
- **Descriptions**: one sentence, flavor + mechanical fact. E.g., "A cleave that bites deep and tears."
- **Effects**: purposeful per skill, NOT element-swapped copies. Passive = `Buff(stat, amt)`.
  Active = `Slash(power, kind)` or `Zone(radius, power, kind)`. Power scales by depth:
  L1 ~1.3× root power, L2 ~1.7×. Costs via `Stamina(amt)` / `Focus(amt)`.
- **Passive roots can spawn active L1 branches** (and vice versa) — makes the tree varied.
- **Elements**: rotate through Physical/Fire/Ice/Lightning/Holy/Dark/Wind/Earth/Water/Arcane.
  Each L1's 5 children should cover ~3-5 different elements for variety.
- **Authored d2/d3 locks** (execute, arrowrain, etc.) are NOT in L2 tables — they're in the
  build list already and appear alongside designed L2 children via the depth walk.

### Execution order
1. ✅ SkillCatalog.cs refactored (partial, BranchSlot, DesignBank, table-driven ExpandTree)
2. ✅ SkillCatalog.Melee.cs (25 L1 + 125 L2 = 150 entries)
3. ✅ SkillCatalog.Ranged.cs (25 L1 + 125 L2 = 150 entries)
4. ✅ SkillCatalog.Magic.cs (30 L1 + 150 L2 = 180 entries)
5. ✅ SkillCatalog.Stealth.cs (25 L1 + 125 L2 = 150 entries)
6. ✅ SkillCatalog.Crafting.cs (25 L1 + 125 L2 = 150 entries)
7. ✅ SkillCatalog.Fortitude.cs (30 L1 + 150 L2 = 180 entries)
8. ✅ Sweep: unique ids, prereq resolution, per-category counts, no orphan refs
   (static grep verified 2026-09-11 — see "Content files created" note above)
9. 🔲 Update PROGRESS.md counts (left in table form — current table still matches), commit with fix:/ui: prefix

### Known issues
- ~~SkillCatalog.cs class doc says ~1034 but actual count is ~1002~~ — FIXED (class doc now says ~1002;
  the 1002 total = 6 cats: 156/157/189/156/157/187 = L0+L1+L2+L3 per 1c-update counts).
- Dev saves referencing old `*_b1..b5` ids will lose those unlocks (acceptable — full content redesign).
- No Unity compile available — verification is static (grep for id graph) + user eyeball.
- `Assets/unused script.md` remains untracked — do not commit.

## 3. Parked / not started
- **Unused-file cleanup** (analysis delivered, waiting on user decision — do NOT act without one):
  - 9 dead scripts (0 refs, GUID not in any scene/asset/prefab):
    `Combat/Effects/CombatAnimation.cs`, `Combat/Effects/RagdollEnabler.cs`, `Networking/Matchmaker.cs`,
    `Player/Controller/OpenWorldGrounding.cs`, `Player/Creation/CharacterCreation.cs`,
    `Player/Races/RaceDiscoveryPoint.cs`, `World/Housing/HousePlotPlacer.cs`,
    `World/Loot/WorldLootPlacement.cs`, `World/Npcs/EconomyProvider.cs`.
  - `Assets/_Recovery/` (16 unreferenced crash scenes), `Assets/TutorialInfo/` (template leftover),
    16 empty folders under `Assets/Scripts`, root dev artifacts
    (`__azurite_db_*.json(.meta)`, `AzuriteConfig`, `_queuestorage__/`, `xoanvnmexel.zip(.meta)`,
    `obj/`, `obj.meta`, `sound.meta`).
  - **DO NOT delete `_Archived/`** (its README says preserve; excluded from Unity build/csproj).
- Race skill tree: no point economy (auto-grant all) — by design for testing; revisit later.

---

## 4. Environment notes
- Windows, Unity project at `D:\unity\new world\new-world`. Shell is PowerShell 5.1 (no `&&`).
- Cannot compile/run Unity from this environment — verification is read-only code review only.
- CRLF warnings on `git diff` are cosmetic; do not "fix" line endings wholesale.
- There is an odd stray file `Assets/unused script.md` (untracked) — likely a leftover, unverified.
